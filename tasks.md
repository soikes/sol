# Current tasks:

- [ ] When clients join the game, they need to be sent a message with the current world state of the zone so they can spawn all existing objects
- [ ] Server needs to be able to communicate custom entities to the client to spawn. Meaning: if I have a "Ship" entity, that ship could be customized in any number of ways including: mesh, speed, weapons, etc.
