# Sol

## Overview
Sol is an online multiplayer sandbox that combines elements of 4X, action RPG and RTS genres set within the reaches of the Milky Way galaxy.

Players start as explorers from the homeworlds of Sol (Mars / Earth) looking to stake a claim somewhere in the galaxy.

Players pilot a ship where they try to find unexplored worlds and systems, establish colonies and grow their empire. Players can pursue greatness through military supremacy, diplomacy, and trade.

Players will be able to form guilds with other players and utilize trading strategies to maximize their resources. Various planets will have different levels of resources so a diverse trading network will provide a significant advantage.

## Game Mechanics
- Isometric 2.5D action
- Player flies around in ship scouting for planets
- Player finds planets to settle and begins a colony
- Real time multiplayer combat
- Reward function for maintaining peace
- Resource mechanics without manual grinding
- Build and grow colonies on planets
- Establish trade networks and partnerships
- Manage population morale
- Customize appearance of race, ships, and colonies
- Defend colonies from attacks in real time
- Build reputation in the galaxy accessible to all players
- Major events broadcast to all players via galactic data feed
- Colony construction is automated by AI and can be influenced by sliders on what to focus on?
- "Planner" element from simcity 2000 - could this be an inspiration?

## Fun bits
- the closer you are to a sun, the higher your temperature reading gets. If you stay in a dangerous zone too long, ship integrity fails

- planets closest to sun will be too hot to inhabit but might have good resources
- planets too far from a sun will be too cold but might also have good resources
- asteroid belts can be mined for materials
- all systems will have a "Goldilocks Zone" where planets will have the right temperature for habitating

- intra-system trade networks can be established but they need to be protected!

- ships will hop from one system to another via:
  - warp gates?
  - personal jump drives?
  - need to read about theoretical technologies and what makes the most sense
  - maybe either of these technologies can be acquired at some stage of the game


- Intergalactic chat and comms
    - Web RTC for voice hailing of other pilots

- Be able to create your own custom race

- Steering controls will use zero gravity and zero wind drag in space
- Steering controls on planets with no atmosphere will act the same
- Steering on planets with an atmosphere will change to look feel and act more like flying a plane
  - What is the difference in terms of motion equations?


- Attacking and defending needs to be scaled based on some concept of rank
  - Attacking a small colony with a lower rank should not yield much

## Open Problems
- How to maintain a "casual" element for a wider audience for a web game?
- How to be competitive without allowing power players to dominate and eliminate players entirely
    - Starport: GE was fun but anyime I established a colony it would be destroyed by the time I logged in again
    - Clash of Clans has maintained its popularity for over a decade - if you are attacked, you lose some resources but your base rebuilds automatically. Casual audiences don't want to invest a lot of time into something where they lose their progress, especially in an open world sandbox
    - Rust is an example of a high stakes game for competitive gamers. The time investment is high but the rewards are high
