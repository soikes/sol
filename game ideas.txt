- the closer you are to a sun, the higher your temperature reading gets. If you stay in a dangerous zone too long, ship integrity fails

- planets closest to sun will be too hot to inhabit but might have good resources
- planets too far from a sun will be too cold but might also have good resources
- asteroid belts can be mined for materials
- all systems will have a "Goldilocks Zone" where planets will have the right temperature for habitating

- intra-system trade networks can be established but they need to be protected!

- ships will hop from one system to another via:
  - warp gates?
  - personal jump drives?
  - need to read about theoretical technologies and what makes the most sense
  - maybe either of these technologies can be acquired at some stage of the game
